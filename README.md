# Shashwath KS - Personal Portfolio (v2025)

This repository contains the complete source code for my personal portfolio website, built from scratch with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It is a fully-responsive, multi-page application designed to showcase my projects, skills, and creative work through a dynamic and highly animated interface.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multi-Page Architecture:** Uses `react-router-dom` for seamless navigation between Home, About, Projects, Media, and Contact pages.
* **Complex CSS Animations:** A heavy emphasis on a fluid user experience, built with pure CSS keyframes, 3D transforms, parallax scrolling, and staggered loading.
* **"Smoking Glass" UI:** A consistent dark-mode "green & black" theme with reusable "smoking glass" card components for a modern, tactile feel.
* **Floating Navigation:** A custom, vertical floating island navigator (`FloatingIsland.jsx`) that expands on hover and indicates the active page.
* **Dynamic Dev Stats:** The homepage fetches and displays real-time statistics from the **GitHub API** (public repos, followers, stars) and **WakaTime** (coding activity).
* **Filterable Media Gallery:** A responsive, animated masonry-style gallery that smoothly filters between "Clicks" (Photography) and "Designs" with no empty spaces.
* **Performance Optimized:** Built with Vite for a lightning-fast development experience and `React.lazy()` for component-level code-splitting in production.
